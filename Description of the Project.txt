ReCell - Project 3 Machine Learning Speciality

Context - The market for cellphones and tables have grown tremendously online and offline in the past decade.
The International Data Corporation forecast has predicted that the used phone market would be worth over $50 billion by 2023
and has a compound growth rate of nearly 14% over the time period of 2018 to 2023. This growth is attributed to the reusage of old devices due to 
the cost of the newer devices.

Objective:

The rising potential of this market fuels the need for a solution to develop a dynamic pricing strategy for used and refurbished devices.
ReCell is a startup aiming to tap the potential in this market and hired you as a data scientist.
Analyze the data provided and build a linear regression model to predict the price of a used phone and identify the factors that influence it.
